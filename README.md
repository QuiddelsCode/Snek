# Snek
Just a silly implementation of Snake storing the number of ticks until the tail leaves a square as a nxn numpy-array to track the snake's position.
This is running on pure python, numpy and tkinter, no game-specific library in sight.

If you want to run it, you'll need python 3.X and numpy installed.

I recommend running it in graphical mode, so use snekGUI.py rather than snek.py which only has a testing interface for console.
